# Book-Recommendation-System
### Part1. Book-Crossing Dataset
This is a dataset collected from a book crossing (圖書漂流) community, containing 278,858 users with 1,149,780 ratings about 271,379 books.
There are 3 csv files in the folder above: Ratings.csv contains 3 columns User-ID, ISBN and Book-Rating.
This file is the training data, containing 1,034,802 (90%) records, by random and stratified sampling. Users.csv contains the detailed information for all 278,858 users, including their locations and ages. Books.csv contains the titles, authors, and much more detailed information about all 271,379 books. Further descriptions can be found in the original dataset website here.
Finally, for those students using this dataset, your recommendation system would be tested by the 114,978 records preserved, and ranked by the accuracy to compare with other students. ±1 from the ground truth rating would still be considered accurate. 

### Dataset Preprocessing and Analysis
After you choose a dataset, you are required to do some preprocessing and analysis on your data. Following are some questions that you need to answer. 
A. Basic Questions (60%)

Q1. (5%) Which labels/features/records can be used to represent user preference (i.e., how much a user likes the item)? Also, what is the total range of the labels/ features/records? Does the higher the value is, the better a user prefers an item, or conversely the lower the better?

Q2. (25%) What did you do to clean the data? Have you done any transformation, integration or deletion? Briefly explain why you did all these cleaning actions. 

Q3. (15%) Sort the users by the number of interactions, and observe what is the minimum number of interactions (Y) generated by the top-X% users? Draw some appropriate figures and briefly explain what your insight is.
(Hint: You can set X-axis as percentage of users, with 10% for a class interval, and set Y-axis as number of interactions. The interactions are for instance, books a user read in Book-Crossing Dataset or Songs a user listened in Echo Nest Dataset.)

Q4. (15%) Sort the items by the number of interactions, and observe what is the minimum number of times (Y) that the top-X% items have been interacted with? Draw some appropriate figures and briefly explain what your insight is.
(Hint: You can set X-axis as percentage of items, with 10% for a class interval, and set Y-axis as times of items that have been interacted with, which are for instance, number of users that a book has been read in Book-Crossing Dataset, or number of users that a song has been listened in Echo Nest Dataset.)

B. Free Exploration (40%)

Q5. (20%) Did you use other datasets or resources to get more information regarding the users and items? If you do, what did you use and why did you choose them? Where did you apply these extra features to help the analysis? And if you don't, what features do you think would be beneficial and where to find them?

Q6. (20%) Freely study your dataset and come up with a question/idea to analyze.
	a. The motivation of the question needs to be meaningful and valuable. Why do you want to study this question? What do you expect to bring out from the analysis?
	b. Define and formulate your question clearly. It is suggested that you provide an example for easy understanding.
	c. At least 1 figure to show your analysis results and several sentences for explanations. Make sure that the figure is representative enough for the question.
	d. Did the results turn out to be the same as your expectation? Why or why not?
